I love you I love you I love you Just to remind you of who you are
Oh love, it will forsake you
Threaten to break you, take what you got
Everybody laughs, everybody cries
Oh it can hurt you baby
But give it a little try
See that's the thing about love
Just to remind you of who you are
Oh love, it will forsake you
Threaten to break you, take what you got
Everybody laughs, everybody cries
Oh it can hurt you baby
But give it a little try
See that's the thing about love
Just to remind you of who you are
Oh love, it will forsake you
Threaten to break you, take what you got
Everybody laughs, everybody cries
Oh it can hurt you baby
But give it a little try
See that's the thing about love
Just to remind you of who you are
Oh love, it will forsake you
Threaten to break you, take what you got
Everybody laughs, everybody cries
Oh it can hurt you baby
But give it a little try
See that's the thing about love
